## Problem

You are given a binary string ```s```. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:


	
- **Type-1: Remove** the character at the start of the string ```s``` and **append** it to the end of the string.
	
- **Type-2: Pick** any character in ```s``` and **flip** its value, i.e., if its value is ```'0'``` it becomes ```'1'``` and vice-versa.


Return **the **minimum** number of **type-2** operations you need to perform** **such that **```s``` **becomes **alternating**.**

The string is called **alternating** if no two adjacent characters are equal.


	
- For example, the strings ```"010"``` and ```"1010"``` are alternating, while the string ```"0100"``` is not.


 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "111000"
Output: 2
Explanation: Use the first operation two times to make s = "100011".
Then, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s = "101010".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "010"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already alternating.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "1110"
Output: 1
Explanation: Use the second operation on the second element to make s = "1010".
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```s[i]``` is either ```'0'``` or ```'1'```.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlips(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        String localStr = s + s;
        char[] t = localStr.toCharArray();
        char[] a = new char[n + n];
        char[] b = new char[n + n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n + n; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                a[i] = '1';
                b[i] = '0';
            } else {
                a[i] = '0';
                b[i] = '1';
            }
        }
        int f = 0;
        int sec = 0;
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < n + n; i++) {
            if (a[i] != t[i]) {
                f++;
            }
            if (b[i] != t[i]) {
                sec++;
            }
            if (i >= n) {
                if (a[i - n] != t[i - n]) {
                    f--;
                }
                if (b[i - n] != t[i - n]) {
                    sec--;
                }
            }
            if (i >= n - 1) {
                ans = Math.min(ans, Math.min(f, sec));
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
