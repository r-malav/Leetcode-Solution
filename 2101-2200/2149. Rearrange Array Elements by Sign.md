## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array ```nums``` of **even** length consisting of an **equal** number of positive and negative integers.

You should **rearrange** the elements of ```nums``` such that the modified array follows the given conditions:


	
- Every **consecutive pair** of integers have **opposite signs**.
	
- For all integers with the same sign, the **order** in which they were present in ```nums``` is **preserved**.
	
- The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.


Return **the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
Explanation:
The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.  
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,1]
Output: [1,-1]
Explanation:
1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.
So nums is rearranged to [1,-1].
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105```
	
- ```nums.length``` is **even**
	
- ```1 <= |nums[i]| <= 105```
	
- ```nums``` consists of **equal** number of positive and negative integers.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        int[] negatives = new int[nums.length / 2];
        int[] positives = new int[nums.length / 2];
        int[] result = new int[nums.length];
        int pPtr = 0;
        int nPtr = 0;
        int rPtr = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > 0) {
                positives[pPtr++] = num;
            } else {
                negatives[nPtr++] = num;
            }
        }
        pPtr = 0;
        nPtr = 0;
        while (pPtr < positives.length && nPtr < negatives.length) {
            result[rPtr++] = positives[pPtr++];
            result[rPtr++] = negatives[nPtr++];
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
