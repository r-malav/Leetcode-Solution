## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array ```tires``` where ```tires[i] = [fi, ri]``` indicates that the ```ith``` tire can finish its ```xth``` successive lap in ```fi * ri(x-1)``` seconds.


	
- For example, if ```fi = 3``` and ```ri = 2```, then the tire would finish its ```1st``` lap in ```3``` seconds, its ```2nd``` lap in ```3 * 2 = 6``` seconds, its ```3rd``` lap in ```3 * 22 = 12``` seconds, etc.


You are also given an integer ```changeTime``` and an integer ```numLaps```.

The race consists of ```numLaps``` laps and you may start the race with **any** tire. You have an **unlimited** supply of each tire and after every lap, you may **change** to any given tire (including the current tire type) if you wait ```changeTime``` seconds.

Return** the **minimum** time to finish the race.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: tires = [[2,3],[3,4]], changeTime = 5, numLaps = 4
Output: 21
Explanation: 
Lap 1: Start with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 seconds.
Lap 2: Continue with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 * 3 = 6 seconds.
Lap 3: Change tires to a new tire 0 for 5 seconds and then finish the lap in another 2 seconds.
Lap 4: Continue with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 * 3 = 6 seconds.
Total time = 2 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 6 = 21 seconds.
The minimum time to complete the race is 21 seconds.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: tires = [[1,10],[2,2],[3,4]], changeTime = 6, numLaps = 5
Output: 25
Explanation: 
Lap 1: Start with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 seconds.
Lap 2: Continue with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 * 2 = 4 seconds.
Lap 3: Change tires to a new tire 1 for 6 seconds and then finish the lap in another 2 seconds.
Lap 4: Continue with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 * 2 = 4 seconds.
Lap 5: Change tires to tire 0 for 6 seconds then finish the lap in another 1 second.
Total time = 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 1 = 25 seconds.
The minimum time to complete the race is 25 seconds. 
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= tires.length <= 105```
	
- ```tires[i].length == 2```
	
- ```1 <= fi, changeTime <= 105```
	
- ```2 <= ri <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= numLaps <= 1000```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumFinishTime(int[][] tires, int changeTime, int numLaps) {
        int minf = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        // find the minimum of f, to deal with special case and stronger constraints later.
        for (int[] tire : tires) {
            minf = Math.min(minf, tire[0]);
        }
        // if min-f >= changeTime, we can return early
        if (minf >= changeTime) {
            return minf * numLaps + changeTime * (numLaps - 1);
        }
        // shortest[i] record shortest time that one single tire is worth to go the i-th laps
        // worth to go means the i-th lap time is shorter than changeTime + f
        int[] shortest = new int[numLaps + 1];
        Arrays.fill(shortest, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        int len = 0;
        // traverse all tires, and update the shortest[i]
        // this shortest time is available from [1, len] in the array
        // len is updated in the traverse
        for (int[] tire : tires) {
            int f = tire[0];
            int r = tire[1];
            // index start from 1 to be consistent with numLaps
            int index = 1;
            int t = f;
            int sum = t;
            // use changeTime + minf here, which is a strong constraints than changeTime + f
            while (t <= changeTime + minf && index <= numLaps) {
                shortest[index] = Math.min(shortest[index], sum);
                t = t * r;
                sum += t;
                index++;
            }
            len = Math.max(len, index - 1);
        }
        for (int i = 2; i <= numLaps; i++) {
            // for j > Math.min(i/2, len), it's simply recombination of the values of shortest
            // [1:len]
            // it's ok to go furthur for the loop, just repeat the Math.min computation
            for (int j = 1; j <= Math.min(i / 2, len); j++) {
                shortest[i] = Math.min(shortest[i], shortest[j] + shortest[i - j] + changeTime);
            }
        }
        return shortest[numLaps];
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.
