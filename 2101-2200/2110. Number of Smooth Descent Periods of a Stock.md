## Problem

You are given an integer array ```prices``` representing the daily price history of a stock, where ```prices[i]``` is the stock price on the ```ith``` day.

A **smooth descent period** of a stock consists of **one or more contiguous** days such that the price on each day is **lower** than the price on the **preceding day** by **exactly** ```1```. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.

Return **the number of **smooth descent periods****.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [3,2,1,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 smooth descent periods:
[3], [2], [1], [4], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1]
Note that a period with one day is a smooth descent period by the definition.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [8,6,7,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 smooth descent periods: [8], [6], [7], and [7]
Note that [8,6] is not a smooth descent period as 8 - 6 ≠ 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 smooth descent period: [1]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= prices.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```1 <= prices[i] <= 10^5```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public long getDescentPeriods(int[] prices) {
        long descendantCount = 0;
        int previousCounts = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length - 1; i++) {
            if (prices[i] - prices[i + 1] == 1) {
                descendantCount++;
                if (previousCounts > 0) {
                    descendantCount += previousCounts;
                }
                previousCounts++;
            } else {
                previousCounts = 0;
            }
        }
        descendantCount += prices.length;
        return descendantCount;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
