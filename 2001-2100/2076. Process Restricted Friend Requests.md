## Problem

You are given an integer ```n``` indicating the number of people in a network. Each person is labeled from ```0``` to ```n - 1```.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array ```restrictions```, where ```restrictions[i] = [xi, yi]``` means that person ```xi``` and person ```yi``` **cannot **become **friends**,** **either **directly** or **indirectly** through other people.

Initially, no one is friends with each other. You are given a list of friend requests as a **0-indexed** 2D integer array ```requests```, where ```requests[j] = [uj, vj]``` is a friend request between person ```uj``` and person ```vj```.

A friend request is **successful **if ```uj``` and ```vj``` can be **friends**. Each friend request is processed in the given order (i.e., ```requests[j]``` occurs before ```requests[j + 1]```), and upon a successful request, ```uj``` and ```vj``` **become direct friends** for all future friend requests.

Return **a **boolean array** **```result```,** where each **```result[j]```** is **```true```** if the **```jth```** friend request is **successful** or **```false```** if it is not**.

**Note:** If ```uj``` and ```vj``` are already direct friends, the request is still **successful**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, restrictions = [[0,1]], requests = [[0,2],[2,1]]
Output: [true,false]
Explanation:
Request 0: Person 0 and person 2 can be friends, so they become direct friends. 
Request 1: Person 2 and person 1 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (1--2--0).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, restrictions = [[0,1]], requests = [[1,2],[0,2]]
Output: [true,false]
Explanation:
Request 0: Person 1 and person 2 can be friends, so they become direct friends.
Request 1: Person 0 and person 2 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (0--2--1).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5, restrictions = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]], requests = [[0,4],[1,2],[3,1],[3,4]]
Output: [true,false,true,false]
Explanation:
Request 0: Person 0 and person 4 can be friends, so they become direct friends.
Request 1: Person 1 and person 2 cannot be friends since they are directly restricted.
Request 2: Person 3 and person 1 can be friends, so they become direct friends.
Request 3: Person 3 and person 4 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (0--4--3--1).
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= n <= 1000```
	
- ```0 <= restrictions.length <= 1000```
	
- ```restrictions[i].length == 2```
	
- ```0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1```
	
- ```xi != yi```
	
- ```1 <= requests.length <= 1000```
	
- ```requests[j].length == 2```
	
- ```0 <= uj, vj <= n - 1```
	
- ```uj != vj```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean[] friendRequests(int n, int[][] restrictions, int[][] requests) {
        // Check for each request whether it can cause conflict or not
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(n);
        boolean[] res = new boolean[requests.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < requests.length; i++) {
            int p1 = uf.findParent(requests[i][0]);
            int p2 = uf.findParent(requests[i][1]);
            if (p1 == p2) {
                res[i] = true;
                continue;
            }
            // Check whether the current request will violate any restriction or not
            boolean flag = true;
            for (int[] restrict : restrictions) {
                int r1 = uf.findParent(restrict[0]);
                int r2 = uf.findParent(restrict[1]);
                if ((r1 == p1 && r2 == p2) || (r1 == p2 && r2 == p1)) {
                    flag = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (flag) {
                res[i] = true;
                // Union
                uf.parent[p1] = p2;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    private static class UnionFind {
        int n;
        int[] parent;

        public UnionFind(int n) {
            this.n = n;
            this.parent = new int[n];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                parent[i] = i;
            }
        }

        public int findParent(int user) {
            while (parent[user] != user) {
                parent[user] = parent[parent[user]];
                user = parent[user];
            }
            return user;
        }
    }
}
```
