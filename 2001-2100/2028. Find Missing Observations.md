## Problem

You have observations of ```n + m``` **6-sided** dice rolls with each face numbered from ```1``` to ```6```. ```n``` of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of ```m``` rolls. Fortunately, you have also calculated the **average value** of the ```n + m``` rolls.

You are given an integer array ```rolls``` of length ```m``` where ```rolls[i]``` is the value of the ```ith``` observation. You are also given the two integers ```mean``` and ```n```.

Return **an array of length **```n```** containing the missing observations such that the **average value **of the **```n + m```** rolls is **exactly** **```mean```. If there are multiple valid answers, return **any of them**. If no such array exists, return **an empty array**.

The **average value** of a set of ```k``` numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by ```k```.

Note that ```mean``` is an integer, so the sum of the ```n + m``` rolls should be divisible by ```n + m```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: rolls = [3,2,4,3], mean = 4, n = 2
Output: [6,6]
Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 6) / 6 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rolls = [1,5,6], mean = 3, n = 4
Output: [2,3,2,2]
Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (1 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2) / 7 = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: rolls = [1,2,3,4], mean = 6, n = 4
Output: []
Explanation: It is impossible for the mean to be 6 no matter what the 4 missing rolls are.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```m == rolls.length```
	
- ```1 <= n, m <= 10^5```
	
- ```1 <= rolls[i], mean <= 6```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] missingRolls(int[] rolls, int mean, int n) {
        int m = rolls.length;
        int msum = 0;
        int[] res = new int[n];
        for (int roll : rolls) {
            msum += roll;
        }
        int totalmn = mean * (m + n) - msum;
        if (totalmn < n || totalmn > n * 6) {
            return new int[0];
        }
        int j = 0;
        while (totalmn > 0) {
            int dice = Math.min(6, totalmn - n + 1);
            res[j] = dice;
            totalmn = totalmn - dice;
            n--;
            j++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
