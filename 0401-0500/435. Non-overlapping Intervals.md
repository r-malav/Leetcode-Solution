## Problem

Given an array of intervals ```intervals``` where ```intervals[i] = [starti, endi]```, return **the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= intervals.length <= 105```
	
- ```intervals[i].length == 2```
	
- ```-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] != b[0] ? a[0] - b[0] : a[1] - b[1]);
        int erasures = 0;
        int end = intervals[0][1];
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < end) {
                erasures++;
                end = Math.min(end, intervals[i][1]);
            } else {
                end = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }
        return erasures;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
