## Problem

Given a string ```s```, return **the number of **homogenous** substrings of **```s```**.** Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** ```10^9 + 7```.

A string is **homogenous** if all the characters of the string are the same.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abbcccaa"
Output: 13
Explanation: The homogenous substrings are listed as below:
"a"   appears 3 times.
"aa"  appears 1 time.
"b"   appears 2 times.
"bb"  appears 1 time.
"c"   appears 3 times.
"cc"  appears 2 times.
"ccc" appears 1 time.
3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "xy"
Output: 2
Explanation: The homogenous substrings are "x" and "y".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "zzzzz"
Output: 15
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```s``` consists of lowercase letters.


## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int countHomogenous(String s) {
        int total = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (i > 0 && s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i - 1)) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count = 1;
            }
            total = (total + count) % 1000000007;
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
