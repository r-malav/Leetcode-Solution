## Problem

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array ```fruits``` where ```fruits[i]``` is the **type** of fruit the ```ith``` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:


	
- You only have **two** baskets, and each basket can only hold a **single type** of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
	
- Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick **exactly one fruit** from **every** tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
	
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.


Given the integer array ```fruits```, return **the **maximum** number of fruits you can pick**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= fruits.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int totalFruit(int[] fruits) {
        int end = 1;
        int basket1 = fruits[0];
        int basket2 = -1;
        int secondFruitIndex = -1;
        int maxTotal = 1;
        int counter = 1;
        while (end < fruits.length) {
            if (fruits[end - 1] != fruits[end]) {
                if (basket2 == -1) {
                    basket2 = fruits[end];
                    secondFruitIndex = end;
                    counter++;
                } else if (fruits[end] == basket1) {
                    basket1 = basket2;
                    basket2 = fruits[end];
                    secondFruitIndex = end;
                    counter++;
                } else {
                    counter = end - secondFruitIndex + 1;
                    basket1 = basket2;
                    basket2 = fruits[end];
                    secondFruitIndex = end;
                }
            } else {
                counter++;
            }
            end++;
            maxTotal = Math.max(maxTotal, counter);
        }
        return maxTotal;
    }
}
```
