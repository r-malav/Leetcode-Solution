## Problem

For an integer array ```nums```, an **inverse pair** is a pair of integers ```[i, j]``` where ```0 <= i < j < nums.length``` and ```nums[i] > nums[j]```.

Given two integers n and k, return the number of different arrays consist of numbers from ```1``` to ```n``` such that there are exactly ```k``` **inverse pairs**. Since the answer can be huge, return it **modulo** ```109 + 7```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: Only the array [1,2,3] which consists of numbers from 1 to 3 has exactly 0 inverse pairs.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The array [1,3,2] and [2,1,3] have exactly 1 inverse pair.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 1000```
	
- ```0 <= k <= 1000```



## Solution

```Python3
class Solution:
    def kInversePairs(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        kMod = int(1e9) + 7
        # dp[i][j] := # of permutations of numbers 1..i with j inverse pairs
        dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

        # if there's no inverse pair, the permutation is unique '123..i'
        for i in range(n + 1):
            dp[i][0] = 1

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, k + 1):
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]) % kMod
                if j - i >= 0:
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] - dp[i - 1][j - i] + kMod) % kMod

        return dp[n][k]
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
