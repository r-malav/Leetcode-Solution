## Problem

Given an integer ```n```, return ```true```** if **```n```** has **exactly three positive divisors**. Otherwise, return **```false```.

An integer ```m``` is a **divisor** of ```n``` if there exists an integer ```k``` such that ```n = k * m```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explantion: 2 has only two divisors: 1 and 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explantion: 4 has three divisors: 1, 2, and 4.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 104```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isThree(int n) {
        int divisors = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                divisors++;
            }
        }
        return divisors == 3;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
