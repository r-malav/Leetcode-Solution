## Problem

There is a **bi-directional** graph with ```n``` vertices, where each vertex is labeled from ```0``` to ```n - 1``` (**inclusive**). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array ```edges```, where each ```edges[i] = [ui, vi]``` denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ```ui``` and vertex ```vi```. Every vertex pair is connected by **at most one** edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

You want to determine if there is a **valid path** that exists from vertex ```source``` to vertex ```destination```.

Given ```edges``` and the integers ```n```, ```source```, and ```destination```, return ```true```** if there is a **valid path** from **```source```** to **```destination```**, or **```false```** otherwise****.**

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex1.png)

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: true
Explanation: There are two paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2:
- 0 → 1 → 2
- 0 → 2
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex2.png)

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,5],[5,4],[4,3]], source = 0, destination = 5
Output: false
Explanation: There is no path from vertex 0 to vertex 5.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 2 * 105```
	
- ```0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 105```
	
- ```edges[i].length == 2```
	
- ```0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1```
	
- ```ui != vi```
	
- ```0 <= source, destination <= n - 1```
	
- There are no duplicate edges.
	
- There are no self edges.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validPath(int n, int[][] edges, int start, int end) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        visited[start] = true;
        boolean newVisit = true;
        while (!visited[end] && newVisit) {
            newVisit = false;
            for (int i = edges.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                if (visited[edges[i][0]]) {
                    if (!visited[edges[i][1]]) {
                        visited[edges[i][1]] = newVisit = true;
                    }
                } else if (visited[edges[i][1]]) {
                    visited[edges[i][0]] = newVisit = true;
                }
            }
        }

        return visited[end];
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
