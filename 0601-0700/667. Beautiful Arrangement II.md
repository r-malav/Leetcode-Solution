## Problem

Given two integers ```n``` and ```k```, construct a list ```answer``` that contains ```n``` different positive integers ranging from ```1``` to ```n``` and obeys the following requirement:


	
- Suppose this list is ```answer = [a1, a2, a3, ... , an]```, then the list ```[|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|]``` has exactly ```k``` distinct integers.


Return **the list** ```answer```. If there multiple valid answers, return **any of them**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: The [1,2,3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1,1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation: The [1,3,2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2,1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= k < n <= 104```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] constructArray(int n, int k) {
        int[] res = new int[n];
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            res[i] = k % 2 == 0 ? left++ : right--;
            if (k > 1) {
                k--;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
