# 2543. Check if Point Is Reachable

- Difficulty: Hard.

## Problem

There exists an infinitely large grid. You are currently at point ```(1, 1)```, and you need to reach the point ```(targetX, targetY)``` using a finite number of steps.

In one **step**, you can move from point ```(x, y)``` to any one of the following points:


	
- ```(x, y - x)```
	
- ```(x - y, y)```
	
- ```(2 * x, y)```
	
- ```(x, 2 * y)```


Given two integers ```targetX``` and ```targetY``` representing the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of your final position, return ```true``` **if you can reach the point from** ```(1, 1)``` **using some number of steps, and **```false```** otherwise**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: targetX = 6, targetY = 9
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to reach (6,9) from (1,1) using any sequence of moves, so false is returned.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: targetX = 4, targetY = 7
Output: true
Explanation: You can follow the path (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,4) -> (1,8) -> (1,7) -> (2,7) -> (4,7).
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= targetX, targetY <= 109```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isReachable(int targetX, int targetY) {
        int g = gcd(targetX, targetY);
        return (g & (g - 1)) == 0; // check g is power of 2
    }
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (a == 0) return b;
        return gcd(b % a, a);
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
