## Problem

There are some prizes on the **X-axis**. You are given an integer array ```prizePositions``` that is **sorted in non-decreasing order**, where ```prizePositions[i]``` is the position of the ```ith``` prize. There could be different prizes at the same position on the line. You are also given an integer ```k```.

You are allowed to select two segments with integer endpoints. The length of each segment must be ```k```. You will collect all prizes whose position falls within at least one of the two selected segments (including the endpoints of the segments). The two selected segments may intersect.


	
- For example if ```k = 2```, you can choose segments ```[1, 3]``` and ```[2, 4]```, and you will win any prize i that satisfies ```1 <= prizePositions[i] <= 3``` or ```2 <= prizePositions[i] <= 4```.


Return **the **maximum** number of prizes you can win if you choose the two segments optimally**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: prizePositions = [1,1,2,2,3,3,5], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: In this example, you can win all 7 prizes by selecting two segments [1, 3] and [3, 5].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prizePositions = [1,2,3,4], k = 0
Output: 2
Explanation: For this example, one choice for the segments is [3, 3] and [4, 4], and you will be able to get 2 prizes. 
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= prizePositions.length <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= prizePositions[i] <= 109```
	
- ```0 <= k <= 109 ```
	
- ```prizePositions``` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximizeWin(int[] A, int k) {
        int res = 0, n = A.length, j = 0, dp[] = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            while (A[j] < A[i] - k)
                ++j;
            dp[i + 1] = Math.max(dp[i], i - j + 1);
            res = Math.max(res, i - j + 1 + dp[j]);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
