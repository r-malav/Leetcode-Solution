## Problem

You are given an integer array ```arr```.

We split ```arr``` into some number of **chunks** (i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.

Return **the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [5, 4], [3, 2, 1] will result in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], which isn't sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [2,1,3,4,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can split into two chunks, such as [2, 1], [3, 4, 4].
However, splitting into [2, 1], [3], [4], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= arr.length <= 2000```
	
- ```0 <= arr[i] <= 10^8```



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxChunksToSorted = function(arr) {
  const sorted = [...arr];
  sorted.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let count = 0,
    sum1 = 0,
    sum2 = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum1 += arr[i];
    sum2 += sorted[i];

    if (sum1 === sum2) {
      count++;
      sum1 = sum2 = 0;
    }
  }

  return count;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
