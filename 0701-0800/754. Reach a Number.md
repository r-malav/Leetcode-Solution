## Problem

You are standing at position ```0``` on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position ```target```.

You can make some number of moves ```numMoves``` so that:


	
- On each move, you can either go left or right.
	
- During the ```ith``` move (starting from ```i == 1``` to ```i == numMoves```), you take ```i``` steps in the chosen direction.


Given the integer ```target```, return **the **minimum** number of moves required (i.e., the minimum **```numMoves```**) to reach the destination**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to -1 (2 steps).
On the 3rd move, we step from -1 to 2 (3 steps).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to 3 (2 steps).
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```-10^9 <= target <= 10^9```
	
- ```target != 0```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int reachNumber(int target) {
        target = Math.abs(target);
        int val = (((int) Math.sqrt(1.0 + 8 * ((long) target))) - 1) / 2;
        int sum = (val * (val + 1)) / 2;
        while (sum < target || (sum - target) % 2 != 0) {
            val++;
            sum = sum + val;
        }
        return val;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
