## Problem

You are given an array ```words``` of size ```n``` consisting of **non-empty** strings.

We define the **score** of a string ```word``` as the **number** of strings ```words[i]``` such that ```word``` is a **prefix** of ```words[i]```.


	
- For example, if ```words = ["a", "ab", "abc", "cab"]```, then the score of ```"ab"``` is ```2```, since ```"ab"``` is a prefix of both ```"ab"``` and ```"abc"```.


Return **an array **```answer```** of size **```n```** where **```answer[i]```** is the **sum** of scores of every **non-empty** prefix of **```words[i]```.

**Note** that a string is considered as a prefix of itself.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["abc","ab","bc","b"]
Output: [5,4,3,2]
Explanation: The answer for each string is the following:
- "abc" has 3 prefixes: "a", "ab", and "abc".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix "a", 2 strings with the prefix "ab", and 1 string with the prefix "abc".
The total is answer[0] = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.
- "ab" has 2 prefixes: "a" and "ab".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix "a", and 2 strings with the prefix "ab".
The total is answer[1] = 2 + 2 = 4.
- "bc" has 2 prefixes: "b" and "bc".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix "b", and 1 string with the prefix "bc".
The total is answer[2] = 2 + 1 = 3.
- "b" has 1 prefix: "b".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix "b".
The total is answer[3] = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["abcd"]
Output: [4]
Explanation:
"abcd" has 4 prefixes: "a", "ab", "abc", and "abcd".
Each prefix has a score of one, so the total is answer[0] = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= words.length <= 1000```
	
- ```1 <= words[i].length <= 1000```
	
- ```words[i]``` consists of lowercase English letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Trie {
    Trie[] ch = new Trie[26];
    int visited = 0;
}
class Solution {
    public int[] sumPrefixScores(String[] words) {
        Trie trie = new Trie();
        int[] ans = new int[words.length];
        int k = 0;
        for (String x: words) {
            Trie t = trie;
            for (int i = 0; i < x.length(); i++) {
                int c = x.charAt(i) - 'a';
                if (t.ch[c] == null) t.ch[c] = new Trie();
                t.ch[c].visited++;
                t = t.ch[c];
            }
        }
        for (String x: words) {
            Trie t = trie; int curr = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < x.length(); i++) {
                int c = x.charAt(i) - 'a';
                curr += t.ch[c].visited;
                t = t.ch[c];
            }
            ans[k++] = curr;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
