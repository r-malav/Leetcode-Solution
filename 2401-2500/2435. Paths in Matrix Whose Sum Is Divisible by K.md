## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** ```m x n``` integer matrix ```grid``` and an integer ```k```. You are currently at position ```(0, 0)``` and you want to reach position ```(m - 1, n - 1)``` moving only **down** or **right**.

Return** the number of paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by **```k```. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** ```109 + 7```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[5,2,4],[3,0,5],[0,7,2]], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by k.
The first path highlighted in red has a sum of 5 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 18 which is divisible by 3.
The second path highlighted in blue has a sum of 5 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 15 which is divisible by 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/17/image-20220817112930-3.png)

```
Input: grid = [[0,0]], k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: The path highlighted in red has a sum of 0 + 0 = 0 which is divisible by 5.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/12/image-20220812224605-3.png)

```
Input: grid = [[7,3,4,9],[2,3,6,2],[2,3,7,0]], k = 1
Output: 10
Explanation: Every integer is divisible by 1 so the sum of the elements on every possible path is divisible by k.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```m == grid.length```
	
- ```n == grid[i].length```
	
- ```1 <= m, n <= 5 * 104```
	
- ```1 <= m * n <= 5 * 104```
	
- ```0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100```
	
- ```1 <= k <= 50```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    int[][][] dp;
    int mod = 1_000_000_007;
    
    public int numberOfPaths(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        dp = new int[rows][cols][k];
        for(int[][] a : dp) {
            for(int[] b : a) {
                Arrays.fill(b, -1);
            }
        }
        
        return helper(grid, 0, 0, 0, k);
    }
    
    int helper(int[][] grid, int r, int c, int sum, int k) {
        if(r < 0 || r == grid.length || c < 0 || c == grid[0].length) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        sum += grid[r][c];
        if(r == grid.length-1 && c == grid[0].length-1) {
            return sum%k==0 ? 1 : 0;
        }
        
        if(dp[r][c][sum%k] != -1) {
            return dp[r][c][sum%k];
        }
        
        dp[r][c][sum%k] = (helper(grid, r+1, c, sum, k) + helper(grid, r, c+1, sum, k)) % mod;
        return dp[r][c][sum%k];
    }
}
```
