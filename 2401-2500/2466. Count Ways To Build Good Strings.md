## Problem

Given the integers ```zero```, ```one```, ```low```, and ```high```, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:


	
- Append the character ```'0'``` ```zero``` times.
	
- Append the character ```'1'``` ```one``` times.


This can be performed any number of times.

A **good** string is a string constructed by the above process having a **length** between ```low``` and ```high``` (**inclusive**).

Return **the number of **different** good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties.** Since the answer can be large, return it **modulo** ```109 + 7```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: low = 3, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: 
One possible valid good string is "011". 
It can be constructed as follows: "" -> "0" -> "01" -> "011". 
All binary strings from "000" to "111" are good strings in this example.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: low = 2, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The good strings are "00", "11", "000", "110", and "011".
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= low <= high <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= zero, one <= low```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int countGoodStrings(int low, int high, int zero, int one) {
        int dp[] = new int[high + 1], res = 0, mod = 1000000007;
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= high; ++i) {
            // if we can add 0 string then add 
            if (i >= zero) dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - zero]) % mod;
            // if we can add 1's string i.e i >= len of 1's string
            if (i >= one) dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - one]) % mod;
            // if i is in between low and high add 
            if (i >= low) res = (res + dp[i]) % mod;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
