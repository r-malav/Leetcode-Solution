## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** positive integer array ```nums``` and a positive integer ```k```.

A pair of numbers ```(num1, num2)``` is called **excellent** if the following conditions are satisfied:


	
- **Both** the numbers ```num1``` and ```num2``` exist in the array ```nums```.
	
- The sum of the number of set bits in ```num1 OR num2``` and ```num1 AND num2``` is greater than or equal to ```k```, where ```OR``` is the bitwise **OR** operation and ```AND``` is the bitwise **AND** operation.


Return **the number of **distinct** excellent pairs**.

Two pairs ```(a, b)``` and ```(c, d)``` are considered distinct if either ```a != c``` or ```b != d```. For example, ```(1, 2)``` and ```(2, 1)``` are distinct.

**Note** that a pair ```(num1, num2)``` such that ```num1 == num2``` can also be excellent if you have at least **one** occurrence of ```num1``` in the array.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The excellent pairs are the following:
- (3, 3). (3 AND 3) and (3 OR 3) are both equal to (11) in binary. The total number of set bits is 2 + 2 = 4, which is greater than or equal to k = 3.
- (2, 3) and (3, 2). (2 AND 3) is equal to (10) in binary, and (2 OR 3) is equal to (11) in binary. The total number of set bits is 1 + 2 = 3.
- (1, 3) and (3, 1). (1 AND 3) is equal to (01) in binary, and (1 OR 3) is equal to (11) in binary. The total number of set bits is 1 + 2 = 3.
So the number of excellent pairs is 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,1,1], k = 10
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no excellent pairs for this array.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= nums[i] <= 109```
	
- ```1 <= k <= 60```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public long countExcellentPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
        long[] cnt = new long[30];
        long res = 0L;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int a : nums) {
            set.add(a);
        }
        for (int a : set) {
            cnt[Integer.bitCount(a)]++;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < 30; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < 30; ++j) {
                if (i + j >= k) {
                    res += cnt[i] * cnt[j];
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
