## Problem

Given a string ```s```, partition the string into one or more **substrings** such that the characters in each substring are **unique**. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than **once**.

Return **the **minimum** number of substrings in such a partition.**

Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 4
Explanation:
Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ssssss"
Output: 6
Explanation:
The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```s``` consists of only English lowercase letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int partitionString(String s) {
        int count = (s.isEmpty()) ? 0 : 1;
        HashSet<Character> letters = new HashSet<Character>(); // creating a set to find unique letters in substring
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (letters.contains(s.charAt(i))) { // if we encounter a duplicate
                letters.clear(); // remove all letters in set
                count++; // increment count
            }
            letters.add(s.charAt(i)); 
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
