## Problem

Given a **positive** integer ```n```, return **the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** **```2```** and **```n```.
 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 10
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 5 and 2 is 10.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 6 and 2 is 6. Note that a number is a multiple of itself.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 150```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        int k=2*n;
        for(int i=2*n;i>=n;i--)
        {
            if(i%n==0&&i%2==0)
                k=i;
        }
        return k;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
