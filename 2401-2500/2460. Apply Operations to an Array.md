## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** array ```nums``` of size ```n``` consisting of **non-negative** integers.

You need to apply ```n - 1``` operations to this array where, in the ```ith``` operation (**0-indexed**), you will apply the following on the ```ith``` element of ```nums```:


	
- If ```nums[i] == nums[i + 1]```, then multiply ```nums[i]``` by ```2``` and set ```nums[i + 1]``` to ```0```. Otherwise, you skip this operation.


After performing **all** the operations, **shift** all the ```0```'s to the **end** of the array.


	
- For example, the array ```[1,0,2,0,0,1]``` after shifting all its ```0```'s to the end, is ```[1,2,1,0,0,0]```.


Return **the resulting array**.

**Note** that the operations are applied **sequentially**, not all at once.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,1,1,0]
Output: [1,4,2,0,0,0]
Explanation: We do the following operations:
- i = 0: nums[0] and nums[1] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- i = 1: nums[1] and nums[2] are equal, we multiply nums[1] by 2 and change nums[2] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,1,1,0].
- i = 2: nums[2] and nums[3] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- i = 3: nums[3] and nums[4] are equal, we multiply nums[3] by 2 and change nums[4] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].
- i = 4: nums[4] and nums[5] are equal, we multiply nums[4] by 2 and change nums[5] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].
After that, we shift the 0's to the end, which gives the array [1,4,2,0,0,0].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: No operation can be applied, we just shift the 0 to the end.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= nums.length <= 2000```
	
- ```0 <= nums[i] <= 1000```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 0 || nums == null) return nums;
        int j = 0;
        for (int i : nums){
            if(i!=0) nums[j++] = i;
        }
        while (j< nums.length){
            nums[j++] = 0;
        }
        return nums;
    }
    public int[] applyOperations(int[] nums) {
        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            if(nums[i] == nums[i+1]){
                nums[i] = nums[i]*2;
                nums[i+1] = 0;
            }
        }
        return moveZeroes(nums);
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
