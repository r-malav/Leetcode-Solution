## Problem

Given a binary tree ```root```, a node **X** in the tree is named **good** if in the path from root to **X** there are no nodes with a value **greater than** X.

Return the number of **good** nodes in the binary tree.

 
**Example 1:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_1.png)


```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
```

**Example 2:**


![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_2.png)


```
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range ```[1, 10^5]```.
	
- Each node's value is between ```[-10^4, 10^4]```.


## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    private int count = 0;

    private void traverse(TreeNode root, int max) {
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }
        if (root.val >= max) {
            count += 1;
            max = root.val;
        }
        traverse(root.left, max);
        traverse(root.right, max);
    }

    public int goodNodes(TreeNode root) {
        traverse(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
        return count;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
