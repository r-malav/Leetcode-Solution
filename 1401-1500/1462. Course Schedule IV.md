## Problem

There are a total of ```numCourses``` courses you have to take, labeled from ```0``` to ```numCourses - 1```. You are given an array ```prerequisites``` where ```prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]``` indicates that you **must** take course ```ai``` first if you want to take course ```bi```.


	
- For example, the pair ```[0, 1]``` indicates that you have to take course ```0``` before you can take course ```1```.


Prerequisites can also be **indirect**. If course ```a``` is a prerequisite of course ```b```, and course ```b``` is a prerequisite of course ```c```, then course ```a``` is a prerequisite of course ```c```.

You are also given an array ```queries``` where ```queries[j] = [uj, vj]```. For the ```jth``` query, you should answer whether course ```uj``` is a prerequisite of course ```vj``` or not.

Return *a boolean array *```answer```*, where *```answer[j]```* is the answer to the *```jth```* query.*

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/courses4-1-graph.jpg)

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]], queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [false,true]
Explanation: The pair [1, 0] indicates that you have to take course 1 before you can take course 0.
Course 0 is not a prerequisite of course 1, but the opposite is true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [], queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: [false,false]
Explanation: There are no prerequisites, and each course is independent.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/courses4-3-graph.jpg)

```
Input: numCourses = 3, prerequisites = [[1,2],[1,0],[2,0]], queries = [[1,0],[1,2]]
Output: [true,true]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= numCourses <= 100```
	
- ```0 <= prerequisites.length <= (numCourses * (numCourses - 1) / 2)```
	
- ```prerequisites[i].length == 2```
	
- ```0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1```
	
- ```ai != bi```
	
- All the pairs ```[ai, bi]``` are **unique**.
	
- The prerequisites graph has no cycles.
	
- ```1 <= queries.length <= 10^4```
	
- ```0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1```
	
- ```ui != vi```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> checkIfPrerequisite(
            int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites, int[][] queries) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> m = new HashMap<>();
        int[] ind = new int[numCourses];
        for (int[] p : prerequisites) {
            m.computeIfAbsent(p[1], o -> new ArrayList<>()).add(p[0]);
            ind[p[0]]++;
        }
        boolean[][] r = new boolean[numCourses][numCourses];
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (ind[i] == 0) {
                q.add(i);
            }
        }
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int j = q.poll();
            for (int k : m.getOrDefault(j, new ArrayList<>())) {
                r[k][j] = true;
                for (int l = 0; l < r.length; l++) {
                    if (r[j][l]) {
                        r[k][l] = true;
                    }
                }
                ind[k]--;
                if (ind[k] == 0) {
                    q.offer(k);
                }
            }
        }
        List<Boolean> a = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] qr : queries) {
            a.add(r[qr[0]][qr[1]]);
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
