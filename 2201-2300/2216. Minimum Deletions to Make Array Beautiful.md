## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array ```nums```. The array ```nums``` is **beautiful** if:


	
- ```nums.length``` is even.
	
- ```nums[i] != nums[i + 1]``` for all ```i % 2 == 0```.


Note that an empty array is considered beautiful.

You can delete any number of elements from ```nums```. When you delete an element, all the elements to the right of the deleted element will be **shifted one unit to the left** to fill the gap created and all the elements to the left of the deleted element will remain **unchanged**.

Return **the **minimum** number of elements to delete from **```nums```** to make it ****beautiful.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,5]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can delete either nums[0] or nums[1] to make nums = [1,2,3,5] which is beautiful. It can be proven you need at least 1 deletion to make nums beautiful.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete nums[0] and nums[5] to make nums = [1,2,2,3] which is beautiful. It can be proven you need at least 2 deletions to make nums beautiful.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 105```
	
- ```0 <= nums[i] <= 105```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDeletion(int[] nums) {
        int offset = 0;
        int res = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < nums.length) {
            int j = i;
            while (j < nums.length - 1 && nums[j + 1] == nums[j] && (j - offset) % 2 == 0) {
                offset++;
                res++;
                j++;
            }
            i = j + 2;
        }
        if ((nums.length - offset) % 2 != 0) {
            res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
