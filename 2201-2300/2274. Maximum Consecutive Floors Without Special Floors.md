## Problem

Alice manages a company and has rented some floors of a building as office space. Alice has decided some of these floors should be **special floors**, used for relaxation only.

You are given two integers ```bottom``` and ```top```, which denote that Alice has rented all the floors from ```bottom``` to ```top``` (**inclusive**). You are also given the integer array ```special```, where ```special[i]``` denotes a special floor that Alice has designated for relaxation.

Return **the **maximum** number of consecutive floors without a special floor**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: bottom = 2, top = 9, special = [4,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: The following are the ranges (inclusive) of consecutive floors without a special floor:
- (2, 3) with a total amount of 2 floors.
- (5, 5) with a total amount of 1 floor.
- (7, 9) with a total amount of 3 floors.
Therefore, we return the maximum number which is 3 floors.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: bottom = 6, top = 8, special = [7,6,8]
Output: 0
Explanation: Every floor rented is a special floor, so we return 0.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= special.length <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= bottom <= special[i] <= top <= 109```
	
- All the values of ```special``` are **unique**.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxConsecutive(int bottom, int top, int[] special) {
        Arrays.sort(special);
        int start = bottom;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int j : special) {
            if (j - start > ans) {
                ans = j - start;
                start = j + 1;
            } else {
                start = j + 1;
            }
        }
        if (ans < top - special[special.length - 1]) {
            ans = top - special[special.length - 1];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
