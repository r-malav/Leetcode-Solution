## Problem

Design a number container system that can do the following:


	
- **Insert **or **Replace** a number at the given index in the system.
	
- **Return **the smallest index for the given number in the system.


Implement the ```NumberContainers``` class:


	
- ```NumberContainers()``` Initializes the number container system.
	
- ```void change(int index, int number)``` Fills the container at ```index``` with the ```number```. If there is already a number at that ```index```, replace it.
	
- ```int find(int number)``` Returns the smallest index for the given ```number```, or ```-1``` if there is no index that is filled by ```number``` in the system.


 
**Example 1:**

```
Input
["NumberContainers", "find", "change", "change", "change", "change", "find", "change", "find"]
[[], [10], [2, 10], [1, 10], [3, 10], [5, 10], [10], [1, 20], [10]]
Output
[null, -1, null, null, null, null, 1, null, 2]

Explanation
NumberContainers nc = new NumberContainers();
nc.find(10); // There is no index that is filled with number 10. Therefore, we return -1.
nc.change(2, 10); // Your container at index 2 will be filled with number 10.
nc.change(1, 10); // Your container at index 1 will be filled with number 10.
nc.change(3, 10); // Your container at index 3 will be filled with number 10.
nc.change(5, 10); // Your container at index 5 will be filled with number 10.
nc.find(10); // Number 10 is at the indices 1, 2, 3, and 5. Since the smallest index that is filled with 10 is 1, we return 1.
nc.change(1, 20); // Your container at index 1 will be filled with number 20. Note that index 1 was filled with 10 and then replaced with 20. 
nc.find(10); // Number 10 is at the indices 2, 3, and 5. The smallest index that is filled with 10 is 2. Therefore, we return 2.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= index, number <= 10^9```
	
- At most ```10^5``` calls will be made **in total** to ```change``` and ```find```.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class NumberContainers {
    private Map<Integer, TreeSet<Integer>> indices = new HashMap<>();
    private Map<Integer, Integer> vals = new HashMap<>();

    public NumberContainers() {}

    public void change(int index, int number) {
        if (vals.containsKey(index)) {
            int old = vals.get(index);
            indices.get(old).remove(index);
            if (indices.get(old).isEmpty()) {
                indices.remove(old);
            }
        }
        vals.put(index, number);
        indices.computeIfAbsent(number, s -> new TreeSet<>()).add(index);
    }

    public int find(int number) {
        if (indices.containsKey(number)) {
            return indices.get(number).first();
        }
        return -1;
    }
}

/**
 * Your NumberContainers object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * NumberContainers obj = new NumberContainers();
 * obj.change(index,number);
 * int param_2 = obj.find(number);
 */
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
