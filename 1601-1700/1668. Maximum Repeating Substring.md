## Problem

For a string ```sequence```, a string ```word``` is **```k```-repeating** if ```word``` concatenated ```k``` times is a substring of ```sequence```. The ```word```'s **maximum ```k```-repeating value** is the highest value ```k``` where ```word``` is ```k```-repeating in ```sequence```. If ```word``` is not a substring of ```sequence```, ```word```'s maximum ```k```-repeating value is ```0```.

Given strings ```sequence``` and ```word```, return **the **maximum ```k```-repeating value** of ```word``` in ```sequence```**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abab" is a substring in "ababc".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ba"
Output: 1
Explanation: "ba" is a substring in "ababc". "baba" is not a substring in "ababc".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ac"
Output: 0
Explanation: "ac" is not a substring in "ababc". 
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= sequence.length <= 100```
	
- ```1 <= word.length <= 100```
	
- ```sequence``` and ```word``` contains only lowercase English letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxRepeating(String sequence, String word) {
        int k = 0;
        StringBuilder repeat = new StringBuilder(word);
        while (sequence.contains(repeat)) {
            k++;
            repeat.append(word);
        }
        return k;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
