## Problem

There is a group of ```n``` people labeled from ```0``` to ```n - 1``` where each person has a different amount of money and a different level of quietness.

You are given an array ```richer``` where ```richer[i] = [ai, bi]``` indicates that ```ai``` has more money than ```bi``` and an integer array ```quiet``` where ```quiet[i]``` is the quietness of the ```ith``` person. All the given data in richer are **logically correct** (i.e., the data will not lead you to a situation where ```x``` is richer than ```y``` and ```y``` is richer than ```x``` at the same time).

Return **an integer array **```answer```** where **```answer[x] = y```** if **```y```** is the least quiet person (that is, the person **```y```** with the smallest value of **```quiet[y]```**) among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than the person **```x```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]
Output: [5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
answer[0] = 5.
Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.
The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but it is not clear if they have more money than person 0.
answer[7] = 7.
Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7 (which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7.
The other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: richer = [], quiet = [0]
Output: [0]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == quiet.length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 500```
	
- ```0 <= quiet[i] < n```
	
- All the values of ```quiet``` are **unique**.
	
- ```0 <= richer.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2```
	
- ```0 <= ai, bi < n```
	
- ```ai != bi```
	
- All the pairs of ```richer``` are **unique**.
	
- The observations in ```richer``` are all logically consistent.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] loudAndRich(int[][] richer, int[] quiet) {
        int[] result = new int[quiet.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < quiet.length; i++) {
            result[i] = i;
        }
        for (int k = 0; k < quiet.length; k++) {
            boolean changed = false;
            for (int[] r : richer) {
                if (quiet[result[r[0]]] < quiet[result[r[1]]]) {
                    result[r[1]] = result[r[0]];
                    changed = true;
                }
            }
            if (!changed) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
