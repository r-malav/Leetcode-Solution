## Problem

You are given an array of unique strings ```words``` where ```words[i]``` is six letters long. One word of ```words``` was chosen as a secret word.

You are also given the helper object ```Master```. You may call ```Master.guess(word)``` where ```word``` is a six-letter-long string, and it must be from ```words```. ```Master.guess(word)``` returns:


	
- ```-1``` if ```word``` is not from ```words```, or
	
- an integer representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word.


There is a parameter ```allowedGuesses``` for each test case where ```allowedGuesses``` is the maximum number of times you can call ```Master.guess(word)```.

For each test case, you should call ```Master.guess``` with the secret word without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get:


	
- **```"Either you took too many guesses, or you did not find the secret word."```** if you called ```Master.guess``` more than ```allowedGuesses``` times or if you did not call ```Master.guess``` with the secret word, or
	
- **```"You guessed the secret word correctly."```** if you called ```Master.guess``` with the secret word with the number of calls to ```Master.guess``` less than or equal to ```allowedGuesses```.


The test cases are generated such that you can guess the secret word with a reasonable strategy (other than using the bruteforce method).

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: secret = "acckzz", words = ["acckzz","ccbazz","eiowzz","abcczz"], allowedGuesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
Explanation:
master.guess("aaaaaa") returns -1, because "aaaaaa" is not in wordlist.
master.guess("acckzz") returns 6, because "acckzz" is secret and has all 6 matches.
master.guess("ccbazz") returns 3, because "ccbazz" has 3 matches.
master.guess("eiowzz") returns 2, because "eiowzz" has 2 matches.
master.guess("abcczz") returns 4, because "abcczz" has 4 matches.
We made 5 calls to master.guess, and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: secret = "hamada", words = ["hamada","khaled"], allowedGuesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
Explanation: Since there are two words, you can guess both.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= words.length <= 100```
	
- ```words[i].length == 6```
	
- ```words[i]``` consist of lowercase English letters.
	
- All the strings of ```wordlist``` are **unique**.
	
- ```secret``` exists in ```words```.
	
- ```10 <= allowedGuesses <= 30```



## Solution

```java
/**
 * // This is the Master's API interface.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * interface Master {
 *     public int guess(String word) {}
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    private int next = 0;

    public void findSecretWord(String[] wordlist, Master master) {
        List<String> list = Arrays.asList(wordlist);
        Collections.shuffle(list);
        boolean[] test = new boolean[wordlist.length];
        while (true) {
            int num = master.guess(list.get(next));
            if (num == 6) {
                break;
            }
            updateList(list, test, num);
        }
    }

    private void updateList(List<String> list, boolean[] test, int num) {
        int index = next;
        for (int i = index + 1; i < test.length; i++) {
            if (test[i]) {
                continue;
            }
            int samePart = getSame(list.get(index), list.get(i));
            if (samePart != num) {
                test[i] = true;
            } else if (next == index) {
                next = i;
            }
        }
    }

    private int getSame(String word1, String word2) {
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            if (word1.charAt(i) == word2.charAt(i)) {
                ret++;
            }
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
```

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
