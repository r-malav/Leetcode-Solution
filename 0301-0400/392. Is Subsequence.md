## Problem

Given two strings ```s``` and ```t```, return ```true```** if **```s```** is a **subsequence** of **```t```**, or **```false```** otherwise**.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., ```"ace"``` is a subsequence of ```"abcde"``` while ```"aec"``` is not).

 
**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```
 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```0 <= s.length <= 100```
	
- ```0 <= t.length <= 104```
	
- ```s``` and ```t``` consist only of lowercase English letters.


 
**Follow up:** Suppose there are lots of incoming ```s```, say ```s1, s2, ..., sk``` where ```k >= 109```, and you want to check one by one to see if ```t``` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int n = t.length();
        int m = s.length();
        if (m == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        while (j < n) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) {
                i++;
                if (i == m) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            j++;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
